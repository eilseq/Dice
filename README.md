## ML Model for Musical Pattern Generation in Max/MSP/Jitter

**DICE** is a Max external that uses a custom-trained model to generate musical patterns based on real-time suggestions from the user. Built with a focus on ethical machine learning, DICE does not utilize any external music datasets, ensuring an original approach to music generation.

## Overview

- **Dynamic Pattern Generation**: Adapts to the musician's input to create responsive musical patterns.
- **Ethical Data Use**: DICE is trained on a custom dataset designed specifically for this tool, avoiding the use of other musiciansâ€™ data.
- **Seamless Max/MSP and Max for Live Integration**: Developed as a Max external for use in Max/MSP patches and Max for Live devices, compatible with Mac OS.
