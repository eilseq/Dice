This license is based on the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 ("AGPLv3"), with additional explicit restrictions described below. Except where explicitly modified herein, all other terms of AGPLv3 apply.

## Purpose

This license exists to protect the DICE project from exploitation while enabling the music community to freely use it to create, share, and empower others through musical expression. It ensures that the Software remains a creative tool for musiciansâ€”not a commercial target or technical component for repackaging.

Legally, this license grants limited rights for musical and audio creativity while explicitly prohibiting redistribution, unauthorized derivative software, and patent abuse. Any attempt to patent or commercially exploit the Software, its methods, or derivative models in violation of this license constitutes a material breach and will result in immediate termination of all granted rights.

## Permission for Music and Audio Asset Creation

Permission is hereby granted to musicians, producers, and individual creators (the "Licensee") to use, modify, and incorporate this software (the "Software") solely for creating musical compositions, audio recordings, soundscapes, and other audio-related assets ("Audio Assets") for personal or commercial purposes. This permission explicitly includes the use of the Software within personal plugins or digital tools exclusively for generating such Audio Assets.

No attribution or credit is required for the use of Audio Assets generated by this Software.

## Explicit Restrictions (Overrides AGPLv3)

**a. No Redistribution:**
Redistribution or incorporation of the Software into plugins, software libraries, frameworks, applications, or tools intended for distribution or licensing to third parties is strictly prohibited, notwithstanding AGPLv3 Sections 5 and 6.

**b. No Derivative Software Products:**
Creation of derivative software applications or products incorporating the Software, or its methods, for any purpose other than generating Audio Assets is explicitly prohibited, notwithstanding AGPLv3 Section 13.

Commercial exploitation of the Software itself (rather than Audio Assets produced using the Software) is prohibited.

**d. No Model Distribution:**
Creation and distribution of machine learning models or related files (such as ONNX, TFLite, or other formats) generated or derived from the Software is explicitly prohibited. Models may be created solely for personal use to generate Audio Assets but must not be distributed or shared. Distribution of such models shall be considered a derivative software product and is strictly forbidden.

**e. No Patent License Grant:**
This license explicitly provides no grant of patent rights or patent licenses. Any implied or explicit patent licensing provisions are hereby expressly disclaimed and overridden.

**f. Patent Prohibition and Assertion:**
Licensees agree not to seek or enforce any patent rights covering any method, feature, or technique embodied in the Software or its usage. Licensees explicitly waive any right to claim patent ownership or to file patent applications related to the Software.

**g. Patent Non-Assertion and Retaliation Clause:**
By using the Software, Licensee agrees not to initiate any patent infringement litigation against the authors or copyright holders concerning any patents related directly or indirectly to the Software. Any license rights granted herein will immediately terminate if Licensee initiates patent litigation against authors, copyright holders, or affiliated entities.
